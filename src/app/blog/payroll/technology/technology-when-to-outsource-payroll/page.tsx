    question: 'Can you handle payroll for fully remote teams across multiple states?',
    answer: 'Yes. Remote-first teams with employees in multiple states are a standard use case. We register in each state, withhold state income tax for each employee&apos;s resident state, and pay state unemployment where the employee works.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you handle RSU vesting events in payroll?',
    answer: 'RSU vesting events require supplemental wage withholding. We coordinate with your equity platform on vesting schedules and process supplemental withholding on vest dates, including the net shares sold for taxes approach when applicable.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you handle commission payroll for our sales team?',
    answer: 'Yes. Commission payroll is processed as supplemental pay runs or integrated into regular payroll. We apply the correct supplemental withholding rate and reconcile commission against draw when applicable.',

    question: 'What does BEG charge for tech company payroll?',
    answer: 'Tech company payroll runs at $25-$45 per employee per month. For a 40-person Series A company, that is $1,000-$1,800 per month covering payroll, multi-state tax filing, W-2s, and equity comp withholding coordination.',

        <p>If you are considering outsourcing payroll for your tech companies, you are likely facing one of the situations that drives the decision: growing past what manual payroll can handle, compliance concerns, losing someone who was handling it, or looking for cost savings.</p>

        <p>Here are the clearest signs that managed payroll is the right move for tech companies.</p>

        <h2 style={{ marginTop: '2rem', marginBottom: '1rem', borderBottom: '2px solid #ECAC60', paddingBottom: '0.5rem' }}>Signs Your Technology & SaaS Companies Needs Managed Payroll</h2>

        <ul style={{ marginLeft: '1.5rem', marginBottom: '1rem' }}>
          <li style={{ marginBottom: '0.5rem' }}><strong>You have received an IRS or state payroll penalty.</strong> A penalty is the clearest signal that your current process has a gap. It rarely fixes itself.</li>
          <li style={{ marginBottom: '0.5rem' }}><strong>You have equity compensation handling.</strong> This is one of the most common sources of payroll error for tech companies. If you are handling it manually, the risk of miscalculation compounds with every pay cycle.</li>
          <li style={{ marginBottom: '0.5rem' }}><strong>You have employees in more than one state.</strong> Multi-state payroll means separate employer registrations, separate withholding requirements, and separate filing deadlines. Managing this manually is feasible but error-prone.</li>
          <li style={{ marginBottom: '0.5rem' }}><strong>You are spending 4+ hours per week on payroll.</strong> At that volume, the time cost alone exceeds managed payroll fees for most tech companies under 50 employees.</li>
          <li style={{ marginBottom: '0.5rem' }}><strong>Your payroll person just left.</strong> Payroll managed by one person creates single-point-of-failure risk. When they leave, payroll still needs to run correctly next Friday.</li>
          <li style={{ marginBottom: '0.5rem' }}><strong>You are growing and adding employees fast.</strong> New hire processing, onboarding setup, and compliance registration scale with headcount. Managed payroll scales with you.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 style={{ marginTop: '2rem', marginBottom: '1rem', borderBottom: '2px solid #ECAC60', paddingBottom: '0.5rem' }}>Why Technology & SaaS Companies Choose BEG Managed Payroll</h2>
