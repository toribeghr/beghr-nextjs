            Minneapolis sits in the Midwest and is a Fortune 500 headquarters market in finance, healthcare, and retail with deep but contested talent. The strongest skilled trades candidates here are already employed and are contacted constantly, which means a job posting reaches the people who are easiest to find, not the ones you actually want. We reach the passive skilled trades talent in Minneapolis and the surrounding MN market directly, before they ever see a listing.

              <p style={{ color: '#cccccc', lineHeight: 1.7, fontSize: '0.97rem' }}>Overtime to cover one unfilled trades position costs $3,000-$5,000 per week at 1.5x base pay rates. At 12 weeks, that is $36,000-$60,000 in excess labor cost - before counting missed production quotas, reduced throughput, and equipment underutilization. A 23-35 day search eliminates the bulk of that exposure.</p>
