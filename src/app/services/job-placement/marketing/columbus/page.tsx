            Columbus sits in the Midwest and is an insurance, finance, and logistics center where mid-market employers compete for the same talent. The strongest marketing candidates here are already employed and are contacted constantly, which means a job posting reaches the people who are easiest to find, not the ones you actually want. We reach the passive marketing talent in Columbus and the surrounding OH market directly, before they ever see a listing.

It freezes campaigns, lets pipeline targets slip, and pushes strategy onto a team that is already executing at capacity. A director seat open for 90 days can cost a company a quarter of lost demand, drifting brand work, and roughly $28,500 in absorbed overhead before the search even ends.</p>
