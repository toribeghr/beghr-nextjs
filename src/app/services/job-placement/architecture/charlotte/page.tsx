            Charlotte sits in the South and is a major banking and financial-services hub with intense competition for finance and compliance talent. The strongest architecture candidates here are already employed and are contacted constantly, which means a job posting reaches the people who are easiest to find, not the ones you actually want. We reach the passive architecture talent in Charlotte and the surrounding NC market directly, before they ever see a listing.

              <p style={{ color: '#cccccc', lineHeight: 1.7, fontSize: '0.97rem' }}>A vacant architect seat does not just slow a project. It pushes deadlines, forces a firm to decline new commissions, and stretches the remaining team past capacity. A project architect seat open for 90 days can cost a firm lost billable hours, a turned-down project, and roughly $28,500 in absorbed overhead before the search closes.</p>

A posting-and-waiting search misses that person every time.</p>
