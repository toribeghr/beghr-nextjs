        <p>Trucking Companies payroll operations involve more moving parts than standard business payroll. per-diem pay for drivers, owner-operator vs W-2 classification, DOT compliance, mileage reimbursement all create operational complexity that grows as your business scales.</p>

        <p>This guide covers how to run Trucking Companies payroll operations efficiently, whether you have 10 employees or 100.</p>

        <h2 style={{ marginTop: '2rem', marginBottom: '1rem', borderBottom: '2px solid #ECAC60', paddingBottom: '0.5rem' }}>Key Operational Challenges in Trucking Companies Payroll</h2>

        <ul style={{ marginLeft: '1.5rem', marginBottom: '1rem' }}>
          <li style={{ marginBottom: '0.5rem' }}><strong>Per-diem pay for drivers.</strong> This affects trucking companies differently than businesses in other industries because of how work is structured and compensated.</li>
          <li style={{ marginBottom: '0.5rem' }}><strong>Owner-operator vs W-2 classification.</strong> This affects trucking companies differently than businesses in other industries because of how work is structured and compensated.</li>
          <li style={{ marginBottom: '0.5rem' }}><strong>DOT compliance.</strong> This affects trucking companies differently than businesses in other industries because of how work is structured and compensated.</li>
          <li style={{ marginBottom: '0.5rem' }}><strong>Mileage reimbursement.</strong> This affects trucking companies differently than businesses in other industries because of how work is structured and compensated.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 style={{ marginTop: '2rem', marginBottom: '1rem', borderBottom: '2px solid #ECAC60', paddingBottom: '0.5rem' }}>Payroll Run Frequency for Trucking Companies</h2>

        <p>Most trucking companies run payroll bi-weekly or semi-monthly. The right choice depends on how your OTR drivers and local drivers are paid. Hourly staff often prefer bi-weekly for faster access to earnings. Salaried management often runs semi-monthly to align with accounting cycles.</p>

        <h2 style={{ marginTop: '2rem', marginBottom: '1rem', borderBottom: '2px solid #ECAC60', paddingBottom: '0.5rem' }}>Managing Payroll Across Multiple Trucking Companies Locations</h2>

        <p>For trucking companies with multiple locations, payroll operations must track hours, pay rates, and tax obligations by location. Multi-state operations add state withholding and unemployment filing requirements in each state where employees work.</p>

        <p>The most efficient approach is a single payroll system with location-based cost centers. This gives you consolidated payroll processing in one cycle with per-location reporting for labor cost analysis.</p>

        <h2 style={{ marginTop: '2rem', marginBottom: '1rem', borderBottom: '2px solid #ECAC60', paddingBottom: '0.5rem' }}>New Hire Payroll Onboarding for Trucking Companies</h2>

        <p>New hire payroll onboarding for trucking companies requires: collecting the W-4 and state equivalent, I-9 verification, direct deposit authorization, benefit enrollment if applicable, and state new hire reporting within 20 days of the hire date. Setting up this process as a checklist prevents missed steps that create compliance exposure later.</p>

        <h2 style={{ marginTop: '2rem', marginBottom: '1rem', borderBottom: '2px solid #ECAC60', paddingBottom: '0.5rem' }}>How Managed Payroll Simplifies Trucking Companies Operations</h2>

        <p>BEG managed payroll at $25–$45 PEPM handles all of the above as part of the base service. Payroll operations run on your schedule without requiring your management team to maintain expertise in per-diem pay for drivers or owner-operator vs W-2 classification.</p>
