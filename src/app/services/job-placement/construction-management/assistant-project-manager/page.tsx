            Strong APMs ready to step up are quickly promoted or poached before a posting closes. That is why a posting-and-waiting search rarely fills a assistant project manager seat with the right person. We source passive assistant project manager candidates directly, screen them against your specific criteria, and deliver a shortlist of 3 to 5 people, not a stack of resumes.

              <p style={{ color: '#cccccc', lineHeight: 1.7, fontSize: '0.97rem' }}>An open project management or field seat does not just sit idle, it puts a job at risk. Schedules slip, change orders stack up, subs go unmanaged, and margin erodes on work that was already bid tight. A PM seat open for 90 days can cost a delayed schedule, blown budget, and roughly $30,000 in absorbed overhead before the search even ends.</p>
