    question: 'Can you handle visit-based pay for home health aides?',

  },
  {
    question: 'How do you handle travel time between client visits?',
    answer: 'Under DOL guidance, travel time between client sites is compensable and must be paid at minimum wage. We include it in the total hours calculation for overtime purposes.',

    question: 'Can you handle multi-state operations?',

    question: 'What does BEG charge for home health agency payroll?',
    answer: 'Home health payroll runs at $25-$45 per employee per month. Visit-based pay, travel time tracking, and Medicaid reconciliation reporting are all included. For an agency with 30 caregivers, that is $750-$1,350 per month.',

        <p>Payroll compliance for home health agencies is not a set-it-and-forget-it problem. DOL live-in caregiver regulations, Medicaid waiver payroll requirements, state home health aide certification records. Each of these areas carries real penalty risk when mishandled.</p>

        <p>This guide covers the primary compliance requirements home health agencies face in payroll and how to stay current without a dedicated in-house compliance specialist.</p>

        <h2 style={{ marginTop: '2rem', marginBottom: '1rem', borderBottom: '2px solid #ECAC60', paddingBottom: '0.5rem' }}>Key Payroll Compliance Requirements for Home Health Agencies</h2>

        <p><strong>Federal requirements.</strong> All home health agencies must withhold federal income tax, FICA (Social Security and Medicare), and pay the employer&apos;s share of FICA. Federal tax deposits must be made on time -- failure to deposit triggers a penalty of 2-15% of the unpaid amount depending on how many days late.</p>

        <p><strong>State requirements.</strong> DOL live-in caregiver regulations, Medicaid waiver payroll requirements, state home health aide certification records. State requirements vary and change frequently. Multi-location home health agencies face multiple sets of state rules simultaneously.</p>

        <p><strong>Industry-specific requirements.</strong> home health agencies face additional payroll requirements beyond standard federal and state rules, including visit-based aide pay, travel time reimbursement, Medicaid billing vs payroll, live-in caregiver rules.</p>

        <h2 style={{ marginTop: '2rem', marginBottom: '1rem', borderBottom: '2px solid #ECAC60', paddingBottom: '0.5rem' }}>Common Compliance Mistakes in Home Health Agencies Payroll</h2>

        <ul style={{ marginLeft: '1.5rem', marginBottom: '1rem' }}>
          <li style={{ marginBottom: '0.5rem' }}><strong>Misclassifying employees</strong> -- especially relevant for home health agencies where registered nurses and LPNs may be paid differently depending on role structure</li>
          <li style={{ marginBottom: '0.5rem' }}><strong>Missing tax deposit deadlines</strong> -- the IRS charges 2-15% penalty for late deposits, and deposits can be required semi-weekly for many businesses</li>
          <li style={{ marginBottom: '0.5rem' }}><strong>Incorrect state filings</strong> -- home health agencies with employees in multiple states must file in each state and maintain separate records</li>
          <li style={{ marginBottom: '0.5rem' }}><strong>Failing to update payroll for rate changes</strong> -- minimum wage, SUTA rates, and state withholding tables change annually in most states</li>
          <li style={{ marginBottom: '0.5rem' }}><strong>Year-end W-2 errors</strong> -- incorrect box entries on W-2s require corrected W-2Cs filed with both the employee and the IRS</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 style={{ marginTop: '2rem', marginBottom: '1rem', borderBottom: '2px solid #ECAC60', paddingBottom: '0.5rem' }}>How Managed Payroll Handles Home Health Agencies Compliance</h2>

        <p>A managed payroll provider handles compliance as part of the base service. Tax table updates, filing deadline tracking, state-specific rule monitoring, and year-end W-2 production are all managed without additional charges per action.</p>

        <p>For home health agencies, the most valuable compliance coverage is visit-based aide pay and travel time reimbursement, which require specialist knowledge that most in-house generalists do not have depth on.</p>
