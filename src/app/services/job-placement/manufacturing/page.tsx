              <h3>How is this different from a staffing agency?</h3>

              <h3>How does milestone-based pricing work?</h3>
              <p>Payments are tied to defined milestones in the search process rather than a lump-sum contingency fee at the end. Total cost is roughly 50% less than a standard contingency arrangement. Exact structure is covered on your discovery call.</p>
