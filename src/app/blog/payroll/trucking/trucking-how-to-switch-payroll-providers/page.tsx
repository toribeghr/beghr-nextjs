        <p>Setting up or managing payroll for trucking companies involves more steps than the basic payroll guides cover. IRS per-diem rates for truckers ($69/day in 2026), FMCSA recordkeeping, state apportionment for multi-state operations applies on top of standard federal requirements.</p>

        <p>This guide covers the specific payroll setup and management requirements for trucking companies.</p>

        <h2 style={{ marginTop: '2rem', marginBottom: '1rem', borderBottom: '2px solid #ECAC60', paddingBottom: '0.5rem' }}>Step 1: Get Your Employer Accounts Set Up</h2>

        <p>Before running payroll for trucking companies, you need an Employer Identification Number (EIN) from the IRS, a state employer withholding account in each state where you have employees, and a state unemployment insurance (SUTA) account. For trucking companies operating in multiple states, this means separate registrations in each state.</p>

        <h2 style={{ marginTop: '2rem', marginBottom: '1rem', borderBottom: '2px solid #ECAC60', paddingBottom: '0.5rem' }}>Step 2: Configure Pay Types for Trucking Companies</h2>

        <p>Trucking Companies have non-standard pay types that require specific configuration: per-diem pay for drivers, owner-operator vs W-2 classification, DOT compliance, mileage reimbursement. Each of these must be set up as a separate pay code in your payroll system with the correct tax treatment applied.</p>

        <p>Missing this step means your system calculates overtime incorrectly, applies the wrong withholding rate, or misses required reporting -- and you do not find out until you receive a penalty notice or employee complaint.</p>

        <h2 style={{ marginTop: '2rem', marginBottom: '1rem', borderBottom: '2px solid #ECAC60', paddingBottom: '0.5rem' }}>Step 3: Set Up Compliance Tracking</h2>

        <p>Trucking Companies payroll compliance requires: IRS per-diem rates for truckers ($69/day in 2026), FMCSA recordkeeping, state apportionment for multi-state operations. Each of these has filing deadlines, rate requirements, or calculation rules that must be maintained current.</p>

        <p>Set up a compliance calendar that tracks: tax deposit deadlines (semi-weekly or monthly based on your lookback period), quarterly Form 941 due dates, annual Form 940 due dates, state quarterly filings, and new hire reporting requirements.</p>

        <h2 style={{ marginTop: '2rem', marginBottom: '1rem', borderBottom: '2px solid #ECAC60', paddingBottom: '0.5rem' }}>Step 4: Run Payroll and File on Time</h2>

        <p>With accounts set up and pay types configured, run payroll on your selected frequency. For trucking companies, bi-weekly or semi-monthly works for most salaried staff. per-diem pay for drivers may require different frequency or supplemental runs.</p>

        <p>Tax deposits must be made on the IRS schedule -- either semi-weekly (if your lookback period tax liability exceeds $50,000) or monthly (if less than $50,000). Missing the deposit date triggers the IRS failure-to-deposit penalty.</p>

        <h2 style={{ marginTop: '2rem', marginBottom: '1rem', borderBottom: '2px solid #ECAC60', paddingBottom: '0.5rem' }}>The Faster Path: Managed Payroll for Trucking Companies</h2>
