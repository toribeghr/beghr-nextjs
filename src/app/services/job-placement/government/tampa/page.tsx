            Tampa sits in the South and is a finance, healthcare, and tech market growing faster than its local professional talent supply. The strongest government candidates here are already employed and are contacted constantly, which means a job posting reaches the people who are easiest to find, not the ones you actually want. We reach the passive government talent in Tampa and the surrounding FL market directly, before they ever see a listing.

It puts deliverables behind schedule, opens compliance and reporting gaps, and exposes an award to penalties or loss. A program manager seat open for 90 days can cost an organization a missed milestone, an audit finding, and roughly $31,500 in absorbed overhead before the search closes.</p>
