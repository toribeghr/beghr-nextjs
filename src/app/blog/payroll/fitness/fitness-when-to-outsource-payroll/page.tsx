    question: 'Can you handle session-based commission pay for trainers?',

      <section className="container" style={{ maxWidth: '840px', lineHeight: '1.6' }}>
        <p>If you are considering outsourcing payroll for your fitness businesses, you are likely facing one of the situations that drives the decision: growing past what manual payroll can handle, compliance concerns, losing someone who was handling it, or looking for cost savings.</p>

        <p>Here are the clearest signs that managed payroll is the right move for fitness businesses.</p>

        <h2 style={{ marginTop: '2rem', marginBottom: '1rem', borderBottom: '2px solid #ECAC60', paddingBottom: '0.5rem' }}>Signs Your Fitness Studios & Gyms Needs Managed Payroll</h2>

        <ul style={{ marginLeft: '1.5rem', marginBottom: '1rem' }}>
          <li style={{ marginBottom: '0.5rem' }}><strong>You have received an IRS or state payroll penalty.</strong> A penalty is the clearest signal that your current process has a gap. It rarely fixes itself.</li>
          <li style={{ marginBottom: '0.5rem' }}><strong>You have trainer 1099 vs W-2 classification.</strong> This is one of the most common sources of payroll error for fitness businesses. If you are handling it manually, the risk of miscalculation compounds with every pay cycle.</li>
          <li style={{ marginBottom: '0.5rem' }}><strong>You have employees in more than one state.</strong> Multi-state payroll means separate employer registrations, separate withholding requirements, and separate filing deadlines. Managing this manually is feasible but error-prone.</li>
          <li style={{ marginBottom: '0.5rem' }}><strong>You are spending 4+ hours per week on payroll.</strong> At that volume, the time cost alone exceeds managed payroll fees for most fitness businesses under 50 employees.</li>
          <li style={{ marginBottom: '0.5rem' }}><strong>Your payroll person just left.</strong> Payroll managed by one person creates single-point-of-failure risk. When they leave, payroll still needs to run correctly next Friday.</li>
          <li style={{ marginBottom: '0.5rem' }}><strong>You are growing and adding employees fast.</strong> New hire processing, onboarding setup, and compliance registration scale with headcount. Managed payroll scales with you.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 style={{ marginTop: '2rem', marginBottom: '1rem', borderBottom: '2px solid #ECAC60', paddingBottom: '0.5rem' }}>Why Fitness Studios & Gyms Choose BEG Managed Payroll</h2>

        <p>BEG manages payroll for fitness businesses at $25–$45 PEPM, all-inclusive. Setup takes 3–5 business days from contract to first live payroll run. We handle the trainer 1099 vs W-2 classification and commission-based training pay requirements that generic software gets wrong.</p>
