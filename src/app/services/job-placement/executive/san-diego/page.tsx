            San Diego sits in the West and is a biotech, defense, and healthcare hub where specialized candidates field multiple offers. The strongest executive candidates here are already employed and are contacted constantly, which means a job posting reaches the people who are easiest to find, not the ones you actually want. We reach the passive executive talent in San Diego and the surrounding CA market directly, before they ever see a listing.

Organizations fill the gap with external consultants ($200-$400/hour), fractional executives, or board member time - all of which cost more than the role itself. Beyond the direct cost, strategic decisions get delayed, teams lose direction, and competitors gain ground. The longer the vacancy, the more expensive the outcome.</p>
