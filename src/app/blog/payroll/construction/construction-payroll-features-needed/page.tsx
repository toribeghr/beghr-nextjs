        <p>Construction Companies need payroll features that go beyond basic hourly and salary processing. The standard payroll software aimed at general businesses often lacks the specific configuration options that construction companies require.</p>

        <p>Here are the payroll features most critical for construction companies.</p>

        <h2 style={{ marginTop: '2rem', marginBottom: '1rem', borderBottom: '2px solid #ECAC60', paddingBottom: '0.5rem' }}>Must-Have Payroll Features for Construction Companies</h2>

        <ul style={{ marginLeft: '1.5rem', marginBottom: '1rem' }}>
          <li style={{ marginBottom: '0.5rem' }}><strong>Multi-rate pay configuration.</strong> construction companies often have laborers and carpenters working at different rates or compensation structures. The payroll system must support multiple pay codes per employee with correct overtime blending.</li>
          <li style={{ marginBottom: '0.5rem' }}><strong>Prevailing wage compliance support.</strong> This is a core requirement for construction companies that generic payroll software often handles incorrectly or not at all.</li>
          <li style={{ marginBottom: '0.5rem' }}><strong>Multi-state tax filing.</strong> construction companies with employees or locations in multiple states need automated state tax filing in each applicable state.</li>
          <li style={{ marginBottom: '0.5rem' }}><strong>Compliance updates.</strong> Tax tables, minimum wage rates, and state-specific rules change annually. The payroll system or provider must apply these updates before they take effect, not after you receive a penalty notice.</li>
          <li style={{ marginBottom: '0.5rem' }}><strong>Year-end W-2 and 1099 production.</strong> All employees receive W-2s. Some workers at construction companies may receive 1099-NEC instead if properly classified as independent contractors. The system needs to produce both correctly.</li>
          <li style={{ marginBottom: '0.5rem' }}><strong>Direct deposit and pay schedule flexibility.</strong> Support for bi-weekly, semi-monthly, and off-cycle runs for bonuses, final paychecks, or mid-cycle adjustments.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 style={{ marginTop: '2rem', marginBottom: '1rem', borderBottom: '2px solid #ECAC60', paddingBottom: '0.5rem' }}>What Most Payroll Software Misses for Construction Companies</h2>

        <p>prevailing wage compliance, certified payroll, union vs non-union, seasonal crew cycles are rarely handled correctly out of the box in standard payroll software. These require configuration work -- and if you do not know the correct rules, you configure them wrong.</p>

        <p>Managed payroll from BEG eliminates the configuration risk. We set up your pay codes based on what construction companies actually need, not generic defaults.</p>
